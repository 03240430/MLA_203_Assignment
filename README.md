# MLA203 FINAL CODE
# AI Future Trading – MLA203 Final Project

This repository contains our group's final project for *MLA203 (Machine Learning Applications)*.  
We developed an *AI-powered futures trading system* using machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques.

## 🚀 Features
- *Reinforcement Learning Trading Bot* (rl_bot.py)
- *Chart Pattern Detection Bot* (chart_bot.py)
- Automatic market data processing and analysis
- Structured modules: bots/, utils/, web/, output/
- Easy installation using requirements.txt
- Main execution scripts included (main.py, restart_both.sh)

## 🧠 Project Summary
Our group successfully built and tested the trading system.  
The RL agent learns trading actions based on price movements, while the chart bot detects market patterns and generates signals.

This project demonstrates practical applications of ML and RL in algorithmic trading.
